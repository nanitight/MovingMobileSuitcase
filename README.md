# MovingMobileSuitcase
<h2>Mobile Suites </h2>
<p>A made up puzzel of T's and Ls inside a box. The navmesh allows the player(suitcase) to travell everywhere on the map and not
cross the borders, or slide through objects.</p> 
<p>The puzzele has 3 areas that affect the play. At one boxed-area the player moves at a speed of 10, while the normal speed is 3,5.</p>
<p> In another area, the suicase changes color, while in another, it does not rotate, and rolls in one steady motion. </p>
